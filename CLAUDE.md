# C++ MCP Server Project

## Project Overview

This is a **C++ MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** implemented in Rust that bridges AI agents with C++ LSP tools (primarily clangd). The goal is to provide AI agents with the same semantic code understanding capabilities that human C++ developers rely on through intellisense.

## Project Context & Rationale

- **Problem**: AI agents use different approaches to browse code - some rely on text search, others on LSP integration
- **Target**: Large C++ codebases with heavy preprocessor usage where humans rely on intellisense
- **Solution**: Bridge AI agents with C++ LSP tools to provide semantic understanding beyond text search
- **Technology Choice**: Rust for resource efficiency when handling large compilation databases

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed

- Full MCP server implementation with rust-mcp-sdk
- CMake project analysis and build directory management (`list_build_dirs`)
- Comprehensive C++ symbol search with project boundary detection (`search_symbols`)
- Deep symbol analysis with inheritance and call hierarchy (`analyze_symbol_context`)
- Clangd LSP client with lifecycle management and indexing progress tracking
- Project vs external symbol filtering using compilation database analysis
- Structured JSON responses with comprehensive error handling
- CI/CD pipeline with build, tests, clippy, and security audit

- Security vulnerability scanning with cargo audit
- GitHub Actions integration with status badges

## Build Directory Management

### Auto-Detection vs Explicit Configuration

Both `search_symbols` and `analyze_symbol_context` tools support flexible build directory configuration:

**Auto-Detection (Default Behavior):**
- Automatically discovers single build directory in current workspace
- Analyzes CMake cache files and compilation database status
- Fails gracefully when multiple or zero build directories found
- Uses `list_build_dirs` tool logic for discovery

**Explicit Configuration:**
- `build_directory` parameter accepts relative or absolute paths
- Validates compile_commands.json presence before proceeding
- Enables working with multiple build configurations
- Supports custom build directory locations outside standard patterns

### clangd Process Management

**Enhanced Startup Behavior:**
- Sets clangd working directory to project root (from CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR)
- Passes build directory via `--compile-commands-dir` argument
- Logs clangd output to `<build_directory>/mcp-cpp-clangd.log`
- Issues warning when changing between non-empty build directories

**Build Directory Changes:**
- Automatically shuts down existing clangd session on directory change
- Warns about potential state inconsistencies during directory switching
- Preserves project root detection from CMake cache analysis
- Maintains indexing progress tracking across sessions

## Architecture Overview

### LSP Integration Layer

- **ClangdManager**: Manages clangd process lifecycle, build directory switching, and file operations
- **LspClient**: Handles JSON-RPC communication, request/response management, and notification processing
- **IndexingState**: Tracks real-time indexing progress with completion detection and estimation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive LSP error mapping to MCP-compatible responses

### Tool Implementation Layer

- **Symbol Search**: Workspace-wide and file-specific symbol discovery with intelligent filtering
- **Symbol Analysis**: Deep context analysis including inheritance, call hierarchy, and usage patterns
- **Project Management**: Build directory analysis, compilation database parsing, and project boundary detection
- **Filtering Logic**: Smart distinction between project code and external dependencies

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **MCP Request** → Handler parses and validates tool parameters
2. **Build Setup** → Automatic CMake detection and clangd initialization if needed
3. **LSP Communication** → Structured requests to clangd with progress tracking
4. **Response Processing** → Filter, transform, and enrich LSP responses
5. **MCP Response** → Structured JSON output with comprehensive metadata

This implementation provides a complete bridge between MCP clients and C++ semantic analysis, enabling AI agents to work with C++ codebases using the same tools and understanding that human developers rely on.

## Testing Framework

### End-to-End Testing

The project includes a comprehensive E2E testing framework in `test/e2e/`:

**Technology Stack:**

- **Vitest**: Modern, fast test runner with TypeScript support
- **ESLint**: Modern .mjs configuration for code quality
- **Prettier**: External formatting tool (not a module dependency)

**Framework Components:**

- **McpClient**: JSON-RPC communication with MCP server over stdio
- **TestProject**: Test project manipulation and CMake operations
- **TestRunner**: Test execution with isolation and cleanup
- **Assertions**: Rich JSON response validation

**Key Features:**

- Isolated test execution with fresh project copies
- Parallel test execution for speed
- Comprehensive fixture system for different project configurations
- MCP protocol compliance validation
- Support for testing server lifecycle and error states

**Running E2E Tests:**

```bash
# First, build the MCP server (required)
cargo build

cd test/e2e
npm test           # Run all tests
npm run test:ui    # Run with UI interface
npm run test:coverage  # Run with coverage report
npm run lint       # Check code quality
```

**Note**: E2E tests require the MCP server binary to be built first. Tests will fail fast with a clear error message if the binary is not found.

**Enhanced Test Identification System:**

The E2E framework now includes a comprehensive test identification system that addresses the issue of UUID-based temp folder names:

- **Descriptive Folder Names**: `list-build-dirs-test-029e7d5a` instead of `test-project-uuid`
- **Test-Aware Logging**: `mcp-cpp-server-list-build-dirs-test.log` instead of generic log names
- **Test Metadata**: Each temp folder contains `.test-info.json` with test context
- **Debug Preservation**: Failed tests can preserve their folders for investigation

**Test Directory Inspector:**

```bash
cd test/e2e
npm run inspect          # View all test directories and metadata
npm run inspect:verbose  # Detailed view with full metadata
npm run inspect:logs     # Include log file analysis
npm run cleanup:dry      # Preview cleanup without removing
npm run cleanup          # Remove all test directories
```

**Complete documentation**: See `test/e2e/README.md` for comprehensive usage guide.

**IMPORTANT E2E Test Debugging Workflow:**

When facing issues with E2E tests, follow this systematic approach:

1. **First, inspect test directories** to identify the failed test run:
   ```bash
   cd test/e2e
   npm run inspect:verbose
   ```

2. **Locate the corresponding logs** for the failed test (look for test-specific log files like `mcp-cpp-server-test-name.log`)

3. **Examine the logs** to understand what actually failed - don't change random things

4. **Use the metadata** in `.test-info.json` to get full context about the test environment

5. **If needed, preserve the test folder** for deeper investigation:
   ```typescript
   await TestHelpers.preserveForDebugging(project, "Reason for investigation");
   ```

6. **Cross-reference clangd logs** when in doubt about MCP server behavior:
   - Check both `mcp-cpp-server-test-name.log` and `mcp-cpp-clangd-test-name.log` from the same test run
   - Clangd logs can validate whether the MCP server is communicating correctly with the LSP
   - Look for LSP request/response patterns, indexing progress, and error messages in clangd logs
   - This helps distinguish between MCP server issues vs LSP/clangd issues

This systematic approach prevents random changes and focuses on actual root causes identified through logs and metadata.
