# C++ MCP Server Project

## Project Overview

This is a **C++ MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** implemented in Rust that bridges AI agents with C++ LSP tools (primarily clangd). The goal is to provide AI agents with the same semantic code understanding capabilities that human C++ developers rely on through intellisense.

## Project Context & Rationale

- **Problem**: AI agents use different approaches to browse code - some rely on text search, others on LSP integration
- **Target**: Large C++ codebases with heavy preprocessor usage where humans rely on intellisense
- **Solution**: Bridge AI agents with C++ LSP tools to provide semantic understanding beyond text search
- **Technology Choice**: Rust for resource efficiency when handling large compilation databases

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

- Full MCP server implementation with rust-mcp-sdk
- CMake project analysis and build directory management (`list_build_dirs`)
- Comprehensive C++ symbol search with project boundary detection (`search_symbols`)
- Deep symbol analysis with inheritance and call hierarchy (`analyze_symbol_context`)
- Clangd LSP client with lifecycle management and indexing progress tracking
- Project vs external symbol filtering using compilation database analysis
- Structured JSON responses with comprehensive error handling
- CI/CD pipeline with build, tests, clippy, and security audit

## Current Tools

### `list_build_dirs`

Analyzes C++ project build environment including:

- Automatic CMake build directory discovery
- Build configuration analysis (generator, build type, compiler settings)
- Compilation database status and file count
- JSON-structured responses with comprehensive project metadata

### `search_symbols`

C++ symbol search with intelligent filtering:

- Fuzzy matching across entire codebase using clangd workspace symbols
- Project boundary detection (project vs external/system symbols)
- Symbol kind filtering (class, function, variable, etc.)
- File-specific search using document symbols
- Configurable result limits and external symbol inclusion

### `analyze_symbol_context`

Deep symbol analysis for comprehensive understanding:

- Symbol definition and type information extraction
- Class inheritance hierarchy analysis

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **MCP Request** â†’ Handler parses and validates tool parameters
2. **Build Setup** â†’ Automatic CMake detection and clangd initialization if needed

5. **MCP Response** â†’ Structured JSON output with comprehensive metadata

This implementation provides a complete bridge between MCP clients and C++ semantic analysis, enabling AI agents to work with C++ codebases using the same tools and understanding that human developers rely on.

## Testing Framework

### End-to-End Testing

The project includes a comprehensive E2E testing framework in `test/e2e/`:

**Technology Stack:**

- **Vitest**: Modern, fast test runner with TypeScript support
- **ESLint**: Modern .mjs configuration for code quality
- **Prettier**: External formatting tool (not a module dependency)

**Framework Components:**

- **McpClient**: JSON-RPC communication with MCP server over stdio
- **TestProject**: Test project manipulation and CMake operations
- **TestRunner**: Test execution with isolation and cleanup
- **Assertions**: Rich JSON response validation

**Key Features:**

- Isolated test execution with fresh project copies
- Parallel test execution for speed
- Comprehensive fixture system for different project configurations
- MCP protocol compliance validation
- Support for testing server lifecycle and error states

**Running E2E Tests:**

```bash
# First, build the MCP server (required)
cargo build

cd test/e2e
npm test           # Run all tests
npm run test:ui    # Run with UI interface
npm run test:coverage  # Run with coverage report
npm run lint       # Check code quality
```

**Note**: E2E tests require the MCP server binary to be built first. Tests will fail fast with a clear error message if the binary is not found.
